Feature: Edit text body
  In order to improve my texts
  As a logged in user
  I need to be able to edit my text bodies

  Background:
    Given I am on "/"
    And I click "Register"
    And I fill in "Name" with "Marcus Aurelius"
    And I fill in "Username" with "marcus-aurelius"
    And I fill in "Email" with "marcus@aurelius.com"
    And I fill in "Password" with "take it easy"
    And I fill in "Repeat password" with "take it easy"
    And I press ENTER
    And I click "New text"
    And I wait "1" seconds
    And I fill in "Title" with "Meditations Revisited"
    And I click "Let's go"

  Scenario: Happy path
    Given I am on "/marcus-aurelius/meditations-revisited/_edit"
    Then I should see "All changes saved"

    When I fill in "Body" with "# This is my level 1 heading"
    Then I should see "Savingâ€¦"

    When I wait "1" seconds
    Then I should see "Draft saved"
    And the text should be saved

    When I click "Save text"
    Then I should see "Text saved. Available on /marcus-aurelius/meditations-revisited."
    And the text should be committed

    When I click "/marcus-aurelius/meditations-revisited"
    Then the "h1" element should contain "Meditations Revisited"
    And the page title should contain "Meditations Revisited"
    And the "h2" element should contain "This is my level 1 heading"
